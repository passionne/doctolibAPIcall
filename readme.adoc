= Doctolib API call

This repo contains some scripts to call doctolib API. I use it to know when my doctor will be availlable as soon as possible.

Note : the bash version use a loop to call doctolib api each 5 minutes and notify-send to show a notification when an timetable was found.


== Exemple of usage :

=== Python version

- Fill array in the begenning of the script with your doctor
- update variable DOCTOLIB_API_PATH with your ID
- launch script :

[source,bash]
----
$> ./checkOphtalmoDispo.py
